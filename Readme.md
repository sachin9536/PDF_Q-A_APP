## Project Overview

This application is designed to handle questions and answers based on PDF document content, with saved history for user interactions. It uses:
- **FastAPI** for backend API and request handling
- **SQLite** for storing metadata and conversation history
- **Google Generative AI (Embeddings)** for document embeddings
- **FAISS** for vector storage and retrieval
- **React.js** for a beautifull, interactive and a very responsive frontend

---

## Features

- **PDF Upload**: Allows users to upload PDF documents.
- **Question-Answer Interaction**: Users can ask questions about the PDF content and receive relevant answers.
- **Conversation History**: Each document’s conversation history is stored, allowing users to resume from their last interaction.
- **Embeddings and Vector Search**: Uses embeddings for efficient information retrieval.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React for a very interactive and fast frontend.

## Architecture Overview

### System Components

1. **React Frontend**: 
   - Provides a user interface for uploading PDFs, asking questions, and viewing answers and also to continue the past conversations.
   
2. **FastAPI Backend**:
   - Handles RESTful API requests, document storage, and NLP processing.
   
3. **Google Generative AI**:
   - Generates embeddings for document content and questions.
   
4. **FAISS Index**:
   - Stores embeddings for fast, semantic search and matching.
   
5. **SQLite Database**:
   - Stores document metadata and conversation history.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (for the frontend)
- **Python 3.9+** (for the backend)
- **FAISS** (for embedding search)
- **Google Generative AI API Key**

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd pdf_qa_app
    ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Create a virtual environment for the backend:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Install required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory and add your Google Generative AI API key:
     ```plaintext
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here/gemini api key here
     ```

4. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
